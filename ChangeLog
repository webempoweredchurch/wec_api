	* trunk/wec_api/class.tx_wecapi_list.php (modified)
	* trunk/wec_api/static/itunes/setup.txt (modified)
	* Modified the way item_enclosure is constructed. It now uses the wec
	constant and a relative url to form the absolute path

	* Modified tx_wecapi_list to use t3lib_TSparser to read in its own
	configuration. This is cleaner than accessing the setup config
	directly.
